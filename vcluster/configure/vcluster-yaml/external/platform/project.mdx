A vCluster can be added to a platform project by specifying the project ID in `vcluster.yaml`. By default,
if you dont set any project in `vcluster.yaml`, vCluster is added to `default` project.

## Example

```yaml
external:
  platform:
    apiKey: vcluster-platform-api-key
    namespace: vcluster-namespace
  project: platform-project-id

```
:::note
Once set, you cannot change the project for a vCluster
:::

If project in `vcluster.yaml` is modified, there wont be any project change on the platform UI. 
However, there would be an warning shown in the vCluster pod running on the host cluster

## Example
The vCluster is imported to project `development` by using following `vcluster.yaml`

```yaml
external:
  platform:
    apiKey:
      secretName: vcluster-platform-api-key
      namespace: vcluster-platform
    project: development
```

Using the following updated `vcluster.yaml` to change the project would result into a warning as shown below

```yaml
external:
  platform:
    apiKey:
      secretName: vcluster-platform-api-key
      namespace: vcluster-platform
    project: production
```

```console
2025-06-19 07:53:38	INFO	online/license.go:174	Trying to register vCluster in the Platform	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-19 07:53:39	ERROR	online/license.go:442		{"component": "vcluster", "error": "vcluster is currently imported in project \"development\", it cannot be moved to \"production\""}
```
