vCluster Platform provides direct integration with Prometheus. With the recommended app kube-prometheus-stack, a complete monitoring setup can be enabled in your cluster with a single click.
To leverage the prometheus integration, you'd have to install the kube-prometheus-stack application from within the platform.


## 1. Install kube-prometheus-stack

Navigate to `Clusters -> CLUSTER -> Overview` and click on the recommended app `kube-prometheus-stack`.

</figure>

```yaml
# Required values by vCluster Platform

```

After pressing _Install_, please be patient until the kube-prometheus-stack is installed.

Congratulations, you now have a fully fledged monitoring setup with vCluster Platform & Prometheus.
