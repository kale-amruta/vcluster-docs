## Parameters

Parameters are a very powerful component of templates. These parameters allow
for giving users that may consume your template a bit of flexibility with
configuration options for certain applications, while still maintaining control over the
possible values the users can select.

When deploying a resource referring to a template with parameters configured, the platform will
prompt the user for their selection for the given parameters. For example, with a parameters
configuration as shown below, the user will get a dialog box where they can select 'one' or
'two' as the value for the `mylabelvalue` variable.

```yaml
- variable: mylabelvalue
  label: StatefulSet Label
  description: Please select the value for the statefulset "my-label" key
  options:
    - one
    - two
  section: Labels
```

The final value of this variable can then be used throughout the template. For example, this
value can be used within the helm values of the virtual cluster chart. In the example below, this value
is being set as a label on the statefulset.

```yaml
labels:
  my-label: "{{ .Values.mylabelvalue }}"
```
