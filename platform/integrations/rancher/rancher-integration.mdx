After [configuring the Rancher integration](configuration.mdx), you can now create and delete virtual clusters from the Rancher UI. Additionally, you can also access the vCluster Platform directly from the Rancher UI.

## Creating a virtual cluster
<Flow id="rancher-plugin-create-vcluster">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher Dashboard, click on the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a name for the virtual cluster and select the Loft Project in which you wish to create the virtual cluster. Only those projects which have the <a href="./configuration/#project-based-rancher-integration">Rancher Integration</a> enabled would be displayed in the list.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the <Button>Create</Button> button which will take you to the <Label>Create VirtualClusterInstance</Label> page within the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the <Label>Rancher</Label> configuration tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Slide the <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> slider to enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create</Button>button once you have configured the same as per your preference.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate back to the Rancher Dashboard. The virtual cluster would be available and in <Label>Active</Label>state.
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Deleting a virtual cluster
<Flow id="rancher-plugin-delete-vcluster">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher Dashboard, click on the Delete icon for the virtual cluster you want to delete.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    You will be redirected to the platform's VirtualClusterInstance Page for confirmation.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Delete</Button> to confirm. The virtual cluster will be deleted from Rancher.
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Importing virtual clusters into Rancher
Once a project has Rancher integration enabled, virtual clusters within that project are eligible to be
synced into Rancher. You can enable virtual cluster import into Rancher during the virtual cluster creation step, or by enabling this feature on existing
virtual clusters.

:::info Make Sure Your Project Has Rancher Enabled.
If the project your virtual cluster resides in does *not* have Rancher integration enabled, you
will not see the Add to Rancher option.

            </Step>
            <Step>
                In the popup, optionally select the virtual cluster template, then click the

            </Step>
            <Step>
                Find your desired virtual cluster in the virtual cluster list. Slide the
                <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> slider to enabled.
            </Step>
        </Flow>

</Tabs>

:::warning Disabling Rancher Integration
You may disable the Rancher integration at a per virtual cluster or per project level by toggling the same sliders
used to enable it. Disabling the integration at the virtual cluster level simply removes it in Rancher.
Disabling the integration at the project level removes all virtual clusters from Rancher, so be careful
when disabled at this level.
:::

Since virtual clusters are not using physical nodes, you may need to hide the nodes from Rancher in order for the
virtual nodes to not be counted in your Rancher node count. In order to do so, you will need to enable a plugin as
part of your virtual cluster deployment.

Add this to your `vcluster.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
plugins:
  rancher:
    image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/rancher-nodeless-plugin:0.0.3
```

Using [templates](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/templates/create?x0=1), you can make sure that all of your vCluster are
using the plugin to avoid unnecessary billing by enforcing the use of the plugin.
